# A Demo of the SYM-1 (6502) Reading a SD Card
**NOTE:** In general, the [sdcard6502](https://github.com/gfoot/sdcard6502) project was used as a starting point.  
Its recommended to take a look at it for more background information.

Below is a photo an overview of the hardware setup for this demo.  
The SYM-1 has 4K of RAM and version 1.1 of the Monitor. 
The console (Serial) interface is use, not the hex-keyboard.
